# Dashboard directory

This directory contains the files which act the actions given from the dashboard onto the actual user.

For example, if the client will click the turn on button for the proxy, there will be a function on the button
which will go to the `proxy.ts` file and turn on the proxy.

## TODO -

### Proxy -
